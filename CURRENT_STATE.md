# Current State

## Active Iteration

Iteration 1 - Syntax MVP (next)

## Completed

- Git repository initialized in `/Users/mingazhev/Repos/meetups/ods_autoresearch` with baseline commit `935eaa5`.
- Iteration worktree created at `/Users/mingazhev/Repos/meetups/ods_autoresearch-iteration0` on branch `iteration-0-contract-first`.
- Iteration 0 solution skeleton created: `CodeMetricsToolkit.sln`, `Abstractions`, `Core`, `Cli`, and `Tests`.
- SDK pinned with `global.json` to .NET SDK `8.0.410`; projects target `net8.0`.
- Roslyn packages pinned to `4.11.0` because SDK `8.0.410` uses compiler `4.11.0`.
- Mandatory output schemas created for `manifest`, `summary`, `metric-result`, `graph`, `chunk`, and `diagnostic`.
- Schema validation tests created with valid fixture output and malformed negative cases.
- Golden sample projects created under `tests/CodeMetricsToolkit.TestAssets`.
- ADRs created for stable target ids, cyclomatic complexity v1.0, and cognitive complexity baseline.
- `implementation_checklist.md` updated for completed Iteration 0 items.

## In Progress

- No implementation slice is currently in progress.

## Next Actions

- Start Iteration 1 from `implementation_checklist.md`.
- Implement project/file discovery and syntax-only C# loading.
- Emit syntax fallback ids for files, types, and members.
- Add first real `codemetrics analyze <path> --output <dir>` CLI path.
- Keep CLI end-to-end smoke unchecked until `analyze` exists.

## Verification

- `dotnet --version`: passed, returned `8.0.410`.
- `dotnet restore CodeMetricsToolkit.sln`: passed.
- `dotnet build CodeMetricsToolkit.sln`: passed.
- `dotnet test CodeMetricsToolkit.sln`: passed, 8 tests.

## Known Decisions

- Work for implementation should happen in `/Users/mingazhev/Repos/meetups/ods_autoresearch-iteration0`, not the main planning worktree.
- Test asset projects are intentionally not added to the solution; `BrokenProject` and nullable diagnostics fixtures are analyzer inputs, not normal build targets.
- `graph.json` and `chunks.ndjson` remain first-class product artifacts.
- `targetIdStability` is required for metric results and chunks.
- Do not start the metric catalog until the CLI smoke path exists.

## Blockers

- None.
